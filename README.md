MSDS 457 - Northwestern University - 2025-2026 NBA Expansion Analysis

NBA expansion was mapped to the Seattle Supersonics for the 2025-2026 season. 8 players from each team were protected based on The Ringer's Expansion protected list they did during expansion week this year in February. Only one player can be chosen per team, and salary must fall between $92.76 million and $187.9 million. The lineup was balanced for positions and teams were selected using linear regression to maximize a chosen analytical statistic while ensuring all parameters were met. Data was scraped from ESPN, basketball reference, pbpstats, spotrac, and nba.com to produce one large datatable. A new analytical statistic was developed from ESPN NET POINTS to try to normalize for team performance, referred to as Net Minus Team Individual and was used as another metric for analysis. Teams' analytical data was summed and plotted against wins, and a regression line was fitted to each plot. This line was used to predict output wins for each of the optimized rosters. While the output data is promising, human insight leans towards holes in the data rather than finding diamonds in the rough, though seeing each team compete to determine how each would fare would be a fun experiment.
